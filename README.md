# TipCalculator
This is a simple tip calculator that helps you to calculate tip. It is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
It requires you to enter the bill amount and tip percentage.<br>
Then it will calculate the tip amount as well as the total bill for you.<br>
I plan on improving the logic to handle wrong user inputs.
